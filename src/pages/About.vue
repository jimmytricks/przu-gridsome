      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm a software developer from the UK.</p>
      <p>
        In my current position I'm mostly working in the C# / .Net ecosystem
        with Vue on the frontend. Lately I've been using React and Cypress for
        testing, and greatly enjoying the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before this I have had experience in other languages and frameworks such
        as PHP, Node, Blazor, Tailwind to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this website I used
        <a href="https://gridsome.org/" target="_blank" class="link-exception"
          >Gridsome</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" class="link-exception"
          >Vue.js</a
        >
        to create a fast and slick site, as an experiment into the
        <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a>, using
        <a href="https://graphql.org" target="_blank" class="link-exception"
          >GraphQL</a
        >
        as the query language. When it comes to CSS, my current preference
        <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" class="link-exception"
          >SCSS</a
        >, or if a library for quick mockups is called for
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" class="link-exception"
          >Tailwind</a
        >
        is a useful tool. For React, I've been enjoying the variety and ease
        provided by Material UI.

        When I'm not coding my favourite activities are playing and watching ice
        hockey & football, surfing, mountain biking and skiing.
