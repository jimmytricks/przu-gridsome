      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm a Web developer from England and have just moved to Edinburgh, UK.</p>
      <p>
        Currently most interested in using
        <a
          href="https://gridsome.org/"
          target="_blank"
          class="link-exception"
        >Gridsome</a> and
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" class="link-exception">Vue.js</a> to create fast and secure sites as part of
        <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a>, using
        <a href="https://graphql.org" target="_blank" class="link-exception">GraphQL</a> as the query language. When it comes to CSS, my current preference
        <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" class="link-exception">SCSS</a>, or if a library is called for
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" class="link-exception">Tailwind</a> is my current favourite. 
      </p>
       <p>Also enjoying getting to grips with Node.js<a href="https://nodejs.dev/Node.js" target="_blank" class="link-exception">Tailwind</a>, as I look to transition into a full-stack developer.</p>
