## Overview

This site was built using my own webpack4 boiler plate, Tailwind CSS and some vanilla JavaScript.

## Webpack

First time configuring and using my own webpack4 setup. There are still some aspects I want to go back and improve but it was useful to have:

* Source maps
* Dev server (with hot reload)
* Babel
* Mini CSS Extract Plugin
* Normalize.css
* SCSS integration

## Features

* Use of MutationObserver API to monitor and change MailChimp success message
* Vanilla JavaScript countdown
