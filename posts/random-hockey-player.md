## Overview

The random hockey player generator was created to coincide with an ice hockey viewing party. I wanted to create a drinking game, where across multiple games several people could have particular players selected.

If that player was to score or assist, the person would take a sip of their drink but it can be used for any other reason that you might want to randomly choose a hockey player. It uses the latest version of players as per the NHL database.

## Features

* Vanilla JS
* Fetch API with chained promises
* NHL Rest API
* Players are not duplicated
* Message notifying when player has picked all players on team
