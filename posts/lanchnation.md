## Overview
Lanchnation is a group of friends with a friendly sport betting pool, with the website showing who is having the best season, etc.

Lanchnation uses Google Sheets as a database, pulling the information on every reload, displaying the current and future bets, along with an auto-updating leaderboard. On the front end it is built with Vue's CLI and ES6. 

I wrote a much more [extensive article here](/posts/google-sheets-db) on how I set up Google Sheets as the database.
